# Change log

Currently building 1.0.11-SNAPSHOT.

## Next

+ Support Latin-9 character set, when feature flag `preferred-name-allow-latin9` is true.
  This is intended to support accent marks in preferred names, like André, François, Nuñez, etc.
+ Allow any preferred last name within the character set, when `preferred-name-allow-any-last-name` is true.
  This is intended to allow self-service setting of preferred last name for people who use a professional last name
  different from their legal last name (for example some academics who marry and change last name but have
  developed a reputation under their prior name) and for people navigating life events wherein legal name might
  lag behind or not match their preference in how to be named in the university setting
  (for example: marriage, separation, divorce, partnership).

## 1.0.10 and earlier
