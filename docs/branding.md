# A note about branding

In May 2022, UW-Madison adopted the more respectful branding "Name in Use" as a successor to the prior "Preferred Name" branding. This recognized that for many, what name to use is not just a "preference". Name can be essential to respecting identity and upholding human dignity.

We updated many user-facing aspects of the application to reflect the new branding. Form labels, error messages, instructions.

We did not update non-user-facing artifacts, to reduce opportunities for error in applying the change and to focus effort on the most valuable changes.

Technical documentation, message keys, class names, test cases, etc., all do not reflect the change away from "preferred name" branding.

That lack of change is not intended to discount the importance of the branding change or to not recognize that "preference" can fail to communicate the importance of what name a person uses to honoring human identity and respecting human dignity.
